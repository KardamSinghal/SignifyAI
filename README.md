# 🤟 SignifyAI: AI-Powered Sign Language Generation from Video

SignVision is an AI-powered computer vision application that detects and interprets sign language gestures from video input. By leveraging **YOLOv5** for real-time object detection, the system identifies hand gestures and maps them to corresponding sign language representations, enabling better accessibility and communication support.

## 🚀 Features  

✅ **Video-Based Input** – Processes recorded videos or live camera feeds.  
✅ **Real-Time Gesture Detection** – Uses **YOLOv5** for fast and accurate detection.  
✅ **Sign Language Recognition** – Identifies predefined sign language gestures.  
✅ **Deep Learning Pipeline** – End-to-end detection using custom-trained models.  
✅ **Scalable Architecture** – Can be extended for real-time or multi-sign support.
